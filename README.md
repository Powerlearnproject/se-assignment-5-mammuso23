3. User Interface Overview:
   - Explain the main components of the VS Code user interface. Identify and describe the purpose of the Activity Bar, Side Bar, Editor Group, and Status Bar.
   **Answer** -The Activity Bar: is on the left in the VS Code window. It shows your VS Code views such as the Explorer, Search, Source Control, Run and Debug, Extensions, Remote Explorer, and other features.
   -Side Bar: it is on the right of the Activity Bar, depending on the selected Activity Bar icon, it can show the files trees, search results, source control changes, debigging information, and installed extensions. 
   -Editor Group: it is located on the center of the VS Code window where you write and edit code. 
   -Status Bar: at the bottom of the VS Code window. It gives information about the editor and the workspace. 

4. Command Palette:
   - What is the Command Palette in VS Code, and how can it be accessed? Provide examples of common tasks that can be performed using the Command Palette.
   **Answer**: The Command Pallete is used to access commands and settings. It can be accessed on Windows/Linux by using 'Ctrl+Shift+P' and on Mac 'Cmd+Shift+P', or easily select View and Command Palette. You can be able to open files and folders, run and install extensions, control operations, debug commands, search and replace files, and other tasks. 

5. Extensions in VS Code:
   - Discuss the role of extensions in VS Code. How can users find, install, and manage extensions? Provide examples of essential extensions for web development.
   **Answer**: Extensions are used to customize VS Code. They allow you to add (feautures,tools, and languages) not included initially when you were installing VS Code. To install extensions: go to the Extensions View, search for the extension (e.g. Python) you want using the search bar, click 'install' on the extension you want to install. Once the extension is installed you can be able to use it. Essential extensions include: GitHub Classroom, GitHub Codespaces, GitHub Pull Requests, Python, and Python Debbuger.

6. Integrated Terminal:

Type your commands in the terminal, enter, and execute them. 
   Advantages of using the intergrated terminal compared to an externa terminal is that it reduces context switching, it reduces the need to switch between different applications. It makes it easier to run scripts and commands on your project without the need to go to the correct folder. You are able to multitask when using the intergrated terminal because you can run several commands with multiple terminal windows.
